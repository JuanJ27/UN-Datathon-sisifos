## Project Overview

This repository contains the work of Team Sisifos from the United Nations Datathon in Medellín, 2024. The project focuses on sustainable tourism in the city, aiming to provide data-driven insights and solutions.

## Data Sources

## Methodology

The project began with an analysis of positive factors (green areas, educational institutions, waterways, tourist attractions, quality of life indices) and negative factors (thefts, violence, illicit substance consumption, gentrification) in Medellín. Temporal trends and spatial distributions were examined, along with correlations between these variables.

Several AI models were developed:

To assist regulatory bodies and the Medellín Mayor's Office in decision-making:

- **Prediction of Tourist Arrivals**: Helps authorities plan resources and infrastructure based on expected visitor volumes
- **Sentiment Analysis on Tourism (AWS)**: Enables monitoring of public perception and community impact
- **Alerting System for GBV (AWS)**: Supports early detection and response to gender-based violence incidents

These models provide valuable data-driven insights for policy making, resource allocation, and public safety measures in the tourism sector.


## Deliverables

A final presentation video was created to showcase the project's outcomes and recommendations.
